Hi. My name is John and this is my personal blog. I created this site to showcase my personal data science and tinkering projects, as well as anything else that comes up. I created this site with the "Clean Blog" Jekyll theme. I took all photos unless noted. The photo on this page was taken by Madeline Kaplan.

I am skilled in machine learning, financial and scientific modeling, statistical analysis, leadership, and communication. I've worked for the Yale Department of Political Science (researching the economic cost of nuclear weapons acquisition), NASA (developing algorithms to detect magnetohydrodynamic waves for the GOES satellites), and BRF (providing financial advice to ultra high-net-worth individuals) and Betterment (doing data science and developing financial advice algorithms for normal people). I'm excited about any project that offers the potential to generate positive social impact by applying cutting edge modeling and analytical solutions.
